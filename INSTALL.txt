SOCNET.SE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
===================================
Socnet.se is a cross-platform C# CLI-based console application for direct
blockmodeling of network data. See README.txt for more information or visit:
https://www.socnet.se

Socnet is developed under the so-called MIT License. Please read LICENSE.txt
before use and/or compiling the source code.

This document explains how to compile the Socnet.se client from source code
that is available on its github repository:
https://github.com/carlnordlund/socnet

1. DEPENDENCIES
===============
To build Socnet.se from source, you need:
- .NET 8.0 SDK or later
  Download this from: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download

Optional (Windows only):
- Visual Studio 2022 (Community Edition or higher)

Note: Socnet.se has also been tested in .NET 10.0 (released mid-November 2025),
with no issues detected during compiling and running.

2. GETTING THE SOURCE CODE
==========================
Clone this repository from GitHub:
  git clone https://github.com/carlnordlund/socnet.git

Navigate to the folder where your copy of the source code is:
  cd socnet

Optional (Visual Studio only):
- It is also possible to clone the repository from Visual Studio,
  i.e. using the github.com URL provided above.

3. BUILDING FROM SOURCE (CROSS-PLATFORM)
========================================
The Socnet.se project can be built using the .NET CLI, which works
the same on Windows, Linux and macOS.

To build in Release mode:

  dotnet build Socnet.csproj -c Release

Binaries will be in:
  bin/Release/net8.0/

To build in Debug mode:

  dotnet build Socnet.csproj -c Debug

This will produce binaries in:
  bin/Debug/net8.0/

4. RUNNING THE APPLICATION
==========================
You can run Socnet.se directly from the .NET CLI:

  dotnet run -- [arguments]

Or by executing the compiled binary (Release mode):

- Windows:
  .\bin\Release\net8.0\Socnet.exe

- Linux / macOS:
  ./bin/Release/net8.0/Socnet
# You may need to make the binary executable:
  chmod +x ./bin/Release/net8.0/Socnet

5. PUBLISHING SELF-CONTAINED BINARIES
=====================================
To compile the source code into stand-alone executables for
different platforms, use the 'dotnet publish' command in .NET CLI:

- Windows (x64, i.e. 64-bit):
    dotnet publish Socnet.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=true -o ./out

- Linux (x64):
    dotnet publish Socnet.csproj -c Release -r linux-x64 --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=true -o ./out

- macOS (x64):
    dotnet publish Socnet.csproj -c Release -r osx-x64 --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=true -o ./out

All published files will be placed in the folder `out/` in the current directory; 
this folder will be created automatically if it does not exist.

Removing the '-o ./out' option will place the compiled output in:

  ./bin/Release/net8.0/<RID>/publish/

...where <RID> is the runtime identifier (e.g. win-x64, linux-x64, osx-x64).

The published self-contained binaries include all required .NET runtime
components, so they can be executed directly without installing .NET.
These are the files that are available as pre-compiled
and code-signed binaries on https://www.socnet.se website.

Supported Runtime Identifiers (RIDs) are as follows:

Windows:
  win-x86       32-bit Intel/AMD
  win-x64       64-bit Intel/AMD
  win-arm64     64-bit ARM (Surface Pro X, modern ARM laptops)

macOS:
  osx-x64     64-bit Intel (older Macs)
  osx-arm64   64-bit ARM (Apple Silicon: M1, M2, M3...)

Linux:
  linux-x64   64-bit Intel/AMD
  linux-arm   32-bit ARM (e.g. Raspberry Pi OS 32-bit)
  linux-arm64 64-bit ARM (Raspberry Pi 4/5 with 64-bit OS, ARM servers etc)

6. PUBLISH WITH VISUAL STUDIO (Windows only)
============================================
Windows users can alternatively open the solution file in Visual Studio 2022:
  Socnet.sln

However, building the Socnet.csproj directly (as shown above) is recommended for
cross-platform reproducibility.

7. NOTES
========
- Socnet.se is cross-platform: it compiles and runs on Windows, Linux and macOS.

- Ensure that the .NET SDK is correctly installed and available in your system PATH
before attempting to build or run.

- Socnet.se was developed using .NET 8.0 (LTS, support until Nov 2026) and
has been tested with .NET 10.0 (LTS, released Nov 2025). Both versions
compile and run successfully.
